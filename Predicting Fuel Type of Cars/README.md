📌 Project Title

Predicting Fuel Type of Cars (Petrol vs. Diesel)

📖 Description
This project builds predictive models to classify whether a car runs on petrol or diesel using Kaggle’s Car Data dataset. Conducted as the final project for STAT207 – Data Science Exploration at UIUC, the analysis applies machine learning techniques to explore how factors such as year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, and transmission impact fuel type classification.

⚙️ Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed a Kaggle dataset of 301 car sales records, handling categorical variables and preparing data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key relationships and distributions to identify trends across car features.

Predictive Modeling: Trained classification models to distinguish petrol vs. diesel vehicles using multiple explanatory variables.

Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using train-test splits, accuracy metrics, and interpretability of explanatory variables.

Business & Environmental Insight: Linked predictions to real-world implications, such as fuel costs and sustainability considerations for car buyers.

📊 Key Insights
Selling price and present price were strong predictors of fuel type.

Transmission type and year of manufacturing also contributed to classification accuracy.

While models provided meaningful insights, improvements could be made with additional categorical features (e.g., brand, car type).
