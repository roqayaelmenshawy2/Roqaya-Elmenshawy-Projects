📌 Project Title

Analyzing the Relationship Between RAM, Operating Systems, and Laptop Prices

📖 Description

This project explores how laptop prices (in euros) vary with the amount of RAM (GB) and across different operating systems. The analysis was completed as part of my Data Science Exploration (STAT 207) course at UIUC, where I applied fundamental data science techniques to gain insights into real-world datasets.

⚙️ Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Selected relevant variables (Ram GB, Price_euros, OpSys) from the dataset and prepared them for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarized dataset statistics and visualized distributions using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Visualization: Created scatter plots and grouped comparisons to reveal patterns in pricing across operating systems.

Statistical Thinking: Investigated relationships between hardware (RAM) and software (OS) with consumer pricing trends.

Python for Data Science: Practiced writing reproducible, well-structured Jupyter Notebooks.

📊 Key Insights

Laptop prices generally increase with higher RAM, but the slope of the increase varies depending on the operating system.

Some operating systems show steeper price increases for additional RAM compared to others.
