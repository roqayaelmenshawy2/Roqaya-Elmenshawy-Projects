📌 Project Title
Predicting Weight from Lifestyle and Health Indicators
📖 Description
This project builds predictive models for estimating weight (kg) based on demographic and lifestyle variables such as height, age, vegetable consumption, daily water intake, and weekly exercise hours. The analysis was conducted as part of my Data Science Exploration (STAT 207) course at UIUC, where I applied regression modeling and data science workflows to health-related data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
⚙️ Skills Demonstrated
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and selected features relevant for predicting weight from the obesity dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated variable distributions, correlations, and visualized relationships with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Predictive Modeling: Built and evaluated regression models to predict weight, applying statistical reasoning to interpret results.
Feature Engineering: Assessed the contribution of variables such as diet and exercise to improve model accuracy.
Applied Machine Learning: Practiced training and validating models on real-world health data.
📊 Key Insights
Height and age are strong predictors of weight, while lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, hydration) also play a meaningful role.
Incorporating multiple explanatory variables improved predictive accuracy compared to univariate models.
